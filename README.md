# PhD thesis experiment code (Chapters 3-6)

In this repository, you can find the Matlab and JavaScript code used to run each of the experiments in my PhD thesis.

## Getting started

The easiest way to access the experiment code is downloading the `.zip` file. To do this:

1. Click the "Code" button and then click the "Download ZIP" option
2. This will download a `.zip` file containing the code to your computer
3. Extract the contents of the `.zip` file to a directory of your choice

Alternatively, you can open the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder where you want to clone this repository, and run the following command: `git clone https://github.com/joelholwerda/thesis-experiments.git`.

## Running the experiments

Each numbered folder from `01_skew_centre` to `09_free_sampling` contains the code used to run one of the experiments.

### Matlab

Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 6 use [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/) and [Psychtoolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/). You will need these installed on your computer. Note that Matlab is proprietary software but you can use [Octave](https://octave.org/) (a free clone version of Matlab) if you do not have access to a licence. To run each experiment, open the `index.m` file in the corresponding folder and click "Run".

### Javascript

Experiments 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 use [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/). These run in the browser ([Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_au/chrome/) recommended) and you do not need to install anything. To run each experiment, open the `index.html` file in the corresponding folder.
