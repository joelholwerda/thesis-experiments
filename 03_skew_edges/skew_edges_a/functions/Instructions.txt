In this experiment, you will be presented with different coloured boxes which represent a different computerized money machine. 
Clicking on a box will lead to winning or losing a number of points (depending on the box you choose). 
The relationship between coloured box and computers does not change during the task, though there could be differences in the number of points produced by each box. 
Your goal is to win as many points as possible which will be translated into actual money at the end of the experiment.



Each box is associated with a computer that generates the points you receive. 
The colour of the box indicates which computer is used. 
The relationship between colours and computers do not change during the task.   


Now that you're familiar with the relationship between boxes and computers, imagine that you now have 100 trials to divide between two boxes from the previous task. 
You should allocate the trials in order to win as many points as possible.

We will now show you two boxes with 50 trials allocated to each box. Use the LEFt and RIGHT arrow keys to change the values under each box. Once you are happy with the values beneath each box, press the RETURN key.
